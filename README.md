## Physical Examination

The platform includes a comprehensive guide to the physical examination of Parkinson's disease, covering the four cardinal signs essential for diagnosis:

### Four Cardinal Signs

1. **Bradykinesia (Required for Diagnosis)**
   - Slowness of movement and reduced amplitude
   - Clinical features: hypokinesia, micrographia, reduced arm swing
   - Examination techniques: finger tapping, hand opening/closing, foot tapping
   - Most disabling feature affecting activities of daily living

2. **Rigidity**
   - Increased muscle tone affecting both agonist and antagonist muscles
   - Clinical features: cogwheel rigidity, lead pipe rigidity, asymmetric onset
   - Examination techniques: passive joint movement, contralateral activation
   - Contributes to characteristic stooped posture

3. **Tremor**
   - Typically rest tremor (4-6 Hz) with pill-rolling movement
   - Clinical features: asymmetric onset, suppressed by voluntary movement
   - Examination techniques: observation at rest, mental distraction, postural testing
   - Most recognizable but not required for diagnosis

4. **Postural Instability & Gait Disturbance**
   - Balance and walking problems appearing later in disease course
   - Clinical features: shuffling gait, festination, freezing, retropulsion
   - Examination techniques: pull test, tandem walking, turning assessment
   - Major cause of falls and disability

5. **Four Joint Motion Assessment (WFE, WAA, EFE, EPS)**
   - Standardized quantitative assessment of specific joint movements
   - **WFE**: Wrist Flexion-Extension - rapid alternating wrist movements
   - **WAA**: Wrist Abduction-Adduction - side-to-side wrist motion
   - **EFE**: Elbow Flexion-Extension - rapid elbow bending and straightening
   - **EPS**: Elbow Pronation-Supination - forearm rotation (palm up/down)
   - Used to quantify bradykinesia and rigidity for disease progression tracking

### Educational Features
- **Interactive Accordion Interface**: Expandable sections for each cardinal sign
- **Clinical Context**: Detailed explanations of examination techniques
- **Key Points Summary**: Essential diagnostic criteria and clinical pearls
- **Severity Indicators**: Clear marking of required vs. supportive features
- **Practical Guidance**: Step-by-step examination instructions

This section provides medical students with the foundational knowledge needed to perform accurate physical examinations for Parkinson's disease diagnosis.

## Case Studies

The platform includes interactive case studies for medical students to learn about different types of Parkinsonian tremors:

### Standard Cases
- **Case 1: Normal Control** - Baseline healthy control subject
- **Case 2: Early-Stage Parkinson's** - Mild resting tremor
- **Case 3: Moderate Progression** - More pronounced bilateral tremor
- **Case 4: Advanced Stage** - Severe tremor impacting daily activities

### Sensation Test
A special interactive test that:
1. **Dynamically syncs** with the case studies configuration from the Live Monitor
2. Randomly selects one of the four configured case studies
3. Plays haptic feedback without revealing the case
4. Prompts the user to identify which case they experienced
5. Provides immediate feedback on their answer
6. Allows multiple attempts with new random selections
7. Tracks test statistics and accuracy over time

**Configuration**: The sensation test automatically uses the files and features configured in the Live Monitor's "Case Studies Configuration" section. When administrators change the case study files, the sensation test immediately reflects these changes without requiring manual updates.

This feature helps students develop their ability to distinguish between different tremor patterns through haptic feedback alone.

### Clinical Simulation
A comprehensive clinical skills assessment that simulates real patient consultations:
1. **Patient History Taking**: Interactive chat interface to practice asking relevant clinical questions
2. **Haptic Examination**: Experience the patient's tremor through haptic feedback
3. **Clinical Diagnosis**: Provide a diagnosis based on history and examination findings
4. **Educational Feedback**: Detailed explanations of correct diagnoses and clinical reasoning

**Features**:
- **Focused Patient Scenarios**: Four carefully selected patient cases covering key movement disorders:
  - Physiological Tremor (Normal Control)
  - Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease
  - Moderate Parkinson's Disease
  - Advanced Parkinson's Disease
- **Interactive History Taking**: Suggested questions and custom question capability
- **Clinical Reasoning**: Students must explain their diagnostic thinking
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Detailed clinical explanations for each case
- **Progressive Learning**: Step-by-step clinical workflow simulation
- **Realistic Patient Profiles**: Diverse demographics, occupations, and clinical presentations
- **Haptic Integration**: Direct haptic feedback experience for each case using configured data files

This feature helps students develop comprehensive clinical skills including history-taking, physical examination interpretation, and diagnostic reasoning for the most clinically relevant movement disorders.

## Hybrid Replay System

The platform implements a **Direct Torque Output** hybrid replay system that combines smooth voluntary movement with controllable tremor overlay:

### **Direct Torque Output Equation:**
```
œÑ = G √ó (Œ∏_base + Œ± √ó A √ó T_raw)
```

Where:
- **œÑ**: Direct torque output
- **G**: Global gain parameter
- **Œ∏_base**: Smooth voluntary movement (low-frequency carrier)
- **A**: Envelope function (amplitude modulation)
- **T_raw**: Raw tremor component
- **Œ±**: Tremor gain parameter (0 ‚â§ Œ± ‚â≤ 1.5)

### **System Behavior:**
- **No Feedback Control**: Direct torque calculation without PD control loop
- **Faithful Reproduction**: Torque directly equals the hybrid replay trajectory
- **Tunable Intensity**: Œ± parameter controls tremor strength
- **Envelope Modulation**: Preserves tremor amplitude variations
- **Smooth Base**: Ensures clean voluntary movement
- **Realistic Range**: Covers practical tremor intensities

### **Parameter Effects:**
- **Œ± = 0**: Pure carrier output (no tremor)
- **Œ± = 1**: Full tremor output
- **Œ± > 1**: Amplified tremor output
- **Œ± ‚â≤ 1.5**: Maximum realistic tremor intensity
- **G**: Scales overall torque magnitude
